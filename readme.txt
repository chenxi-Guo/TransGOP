# TransGOP #
Gaze object prediction (GOP) aims to predict the location of the object that is watched by a human. Previous gaze object prediction works use CNN-based object detectors to predict the object location. However, we find that Transformer-based object detectors can predict more accurate object location for the objects that are close to human or goods shelves due to the ability of self-attention mechanism in building long dependencies. To this end, this paper introduces Transformer into the fields of gaze object prediction and proposes an end-to-end Transformer-based gaze object prediction method named TransGOP. Specifically, TransGOP uses of-the-shelf Transformer-based object detector to detect the location of objects, and fed the fused feature of the head image and scene image into a Transformer-based gaze prediction branch to regress the gaze heatmap. Moreover, to better enhance the gaze regressor by the informative knowledge from the object detectors, we propose an object-to-gaze attention mechanism to let the queries in the gaze regressor receive the encoded features of the object detector. Finally, to make the whole framework can be end-to-end trained, we propose a Gaze Box loss to jointly optimize the object detector and gaze regressor by enhancing the gaze energy in the box of the stared object. Extensive experiments on the GOO-Synth and GOO-Real datasets demonstrate that our TransGOP achieves state-of-the-art performance on all tracks, i.e. , object detection, gaze estimation, and gaze object prediction. On the GOO-Synth dataset, TransGOP can outperform the state-of-the-art CNN-based method by 24.9% in terms of mSoC.
